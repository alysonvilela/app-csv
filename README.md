## TODO
- Architecture flow
- Explain streaming basics
- Explain the use of PUB/SUBS (would change for kafka/redis or another message broker service)
- Testing with vitest
- Docker and docker compose
- Explain why I started the project with Bun and ended up with PNPM/NPM (clusters and upscaling with PM2)
- Possible architecture changings: Buckets, Message brokers 
- Services/project next steps: Insert validation (we are still passing through if the PK/unique key exists), Status field and update on demand, Better IOC configuration(typescript-ioc/tsyringe/inversify), When there is a bucket service might be good creating new services/jobs to remove unused files/
- Swagger
